This brief disclosure document is a starting point for general disclosures related to individual cryptoasset projects. We have drafted a list of simple, non-controversial, objective, and verifiable disclosures which we believe would be materially helpful to crypto users who are evaluating new projects and the merits of their associated cryptoassets. We welcome comments and additional contributions to this list.

1) CryptoAsset Overview
Project Mission and Description 
+ 1000 characters max (wikipedia intro length) - No marketing language and limited jargon; Messari team will approve submissions (a la CB Insights)

Organizational Structure
+ Who are the primary issuing and supporting organizations for the project? 
+ Where and how are these entities structured?
+ Who controls and governs these entities? (OPTIONAL for opsec reasons)

Verified Project Web Assets 
+ Project website & token sale information
+ Github repo
+ Final white paper (at token issuance) and link to where / how updates are documented
+ Social media links (twitter, telegram, reddit, slack) - prevent spamming

2) Envisioned Post-Token Issuance “Cap Table”
Token Distribution “Snapshot”
